<h1>Disliked Websites</h1>
<p> Here we are going to talk about 2 of the worst websites in my opinion. I will describe how i feel based on a website written by
 <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-mistakes-web-design/">Jakob Neilsen</a>
<h2><a href="arngren.net">arngren.net</a> </h2>
<p>
This is a site that is very hard to navigate. For starters it violates bad convention number 8 on Neilsons list of worst web pages by breaking away from website conventions. 
The page is completely disorganized. It looks like someone simply wanted to squeeze as much merchandise as possible onto the home page. In my opinion this was designed to look more 
like a kids toy catalog than a website to be navigated by an adult. Number 7 on Neilsons list says a website should avoid making relevant information look like an advertisement or it 
will be ignored. Everything on this site looks like an advertisement. The search bar is easy to find however when you put in a search,(like, lets say bike) it takes you to a search
 page that is only labeled search for the title of this page. For those who dont use many tabs at a time this is no problem but for us die hard web users this would get very confusing 
if multiple sites used this title. This is violation number 6 on Neilsons list. Returning to the home page, as you scroll down you will notice several randomly placed animations
that make this page even more busy and also accounts for violation number 7 yet again
</p>
<h2><a href="cosmoplanes.com">cosmoplanes.com</a></h2>
<p>Cosmoplanes is a fine example of a website that goes obove an beyond at breaking rule number 8, violating design conventions. In the case of this website I kind of fear 
spending to much time on it in case I might get a virus. The navigation links start out towards the bottom of what you can see of the page when you first open it up and it
 almost gives you th impression that the pretty picture in the background is the main purpose of the page. It then breaks with convention again by giving you some random 
galaxy pictures and some leader boards without a title. This makes the page very hard to navigate and it definatley isn't go to be much good at drawing in new users for their blog. 
Combine all of this and I believe this page also violates number 10 on Neilsons list. Violation 10 is where a user cant find what the are looking for or in better words the question 
&quot;Why am I here?&quot; is not gonna be answered. Whenever you click on one of the links in their navigation pane it takes a bit of time for the page to render. If you then ckick
 the back button you will notice that the linkn you selected did not change color which breaks violation number 3. The links changing color is what allows you to know where you have 
been. So whether you need to return to a link you've used or discredit a link you've used, there will be no help from this site.

<h1> Liked websites</h1>
<p> You saw what I disliked. Now heres a few examples of sites I <strong>do</strong> like!</p>
<h2><a href="tesla.com">tesla.com</a> </h2>
<p>I am an Elon Musk fan. All the tech he has been advanceing is euphoric to read about and that probably influenced mh decission here. The site itself is very pretty and simple. 
I woud like to point out that it is immediatley noticable that it breaks with violation 3 because the links do not change colour when you select them and it breaks with violation
8 by breaking away with design conventions. If you try to use the scroll bar the way I did, (click the bar and drag it) It dosn't move the page.
 The links I imagine dont change because they didn't want the asthetic look of their web page ruined and its realy no surprise that a tesla site would break from conventions on the 
scroll bar. Breaking conventions is what Musk does. Do to the simplicity of the page I could overlook the weblinks however the scroll bar was slightly anoying until I figured out
that by clicking my keyboards arrows it changed the sites layout like you were looking through slides of concept art. It realy has a nice look and feel after that. A search bar is 
not readily available and only appears when you hit the shop link. Here is another place of concern because clicking this link removes links to things like the solar panels. 
So lets say you wish to purchase the panels so you choose shop. on the shop page you realize theres no solar panels here so you search for them in the search bar only to get a 
wall panel car charger for a result. This clearly violates violation number one on Neilsons list &amp;bad searches&amp;. 
</p>
<h2><a href=google.com>google.com</a></h2>
<p>Okay I know this sounds simple but when you ask me my favourite The first thing that honestly comes to mind is of course google. Any question I ask is at the tip of my fingers
or with the right device, I can just say "hey google". The website itself is supper simple, nothing added. It simply has a search bar for your querys and a place to sign in. If you
 are a gmail user then you have a google account. this gives you an account with youtube and the play store, just to name a few and all you have to do is click the image of 6 dots 
at the top right and select what you want. For me google is a major part of my life and something that is used many times a day. the site provides the sort of
 parental controls for my kids devices that many parents pay for on different apps. I wont go on for long on google. Truth is the website itself is very simple and easy to use and 
while it may not be on any list for the best website it is still my favourite.
