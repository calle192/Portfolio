       <li>The Header Element</li>

   <p>
     The H elements are header elements that allow you to seperate your webpage
     Into sections. This makes your webpage easier to navigate for users. 
     There are six h elements &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;. h1 is the largest and most
     noticeable. The h elements continue to get smaller as you work your way
     to &lt;h6&gt;. You can make shortcuts in your page by giveing your h elements
     an id. You can make a link at the top of the page, or make a link from 
     a seperate page that leads directly to that location by using the 
     anchor tag.
   </p>
  <h1>The Form Element </h1>
   <p>The form element is used to make a container for different input 
      elements.Within the form are inputs types such as text, radio buttons,
      checkboxes etc. Within the form tag there is an attribute named action. 
      This attribute is used to specify the form handler for the form. The
      form handler is a document that contains the appropriate script which
      contains the procedures needed to process the form. The form tag will
      look like this &lt;form action=some.php&gt;. To make an element within
      the form you use the input tag with its tyoe and its value. for example
      &lt;input type="text" value="Mike"&gt;. If I wanted a label to signify 
      what the input is for I can add an id attribute to the input tag. Then
      I can add a label tag. This is an example &lt;label for="id name"&gt;
      Heres the label name&lt;/label&gt;. </p>
  <h1>The Anchor Element</h1>
   <p>The anchor tag is used to create links. These links can lead to other
      web pages, other web sites or as a shortcut to a particular position
      on the web page you are already on. This is an example of an anchor
      element &lt;a href="website.html"&gt;name user sees goes here&lt;/a&gt; 
      to make a tag to a particular place on a web page you would give an
       element such as a header tag or a picture element an id. You would 
      then use this id in the href attribute. To link to a comletely 
      diferent web page you would need to include the absolute file path in the
      href attribute. An example of an absolute file path is http://www.boom.com.
