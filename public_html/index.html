<p>When I first strated college my goal was to become a computer and electrical engineer. In my first semester I took programming concepts where I learned
  the basics of modular programming and JavaScript. I fell in love with it. Since then I've earned my Associates in Applied Science in Computer Programming Specialist.
  Afterwards I started attending Kennesaw State University where I am earning my Bachelors in Information Technology with a focus on Computer 
  Programming and a minor in Computer Science.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Programming is a very rewarding element to learn. I have taken C#, Java, JavaScript, Visual Basic, HTML, and SQL already. Some of these classes I took years
ago like HTML and JavaScript. Thats the first important thing I beleive I will get out of this class, the chance to re-learn those two and learn how to put them together to do something 
cooler than what I knew before. The second thing that I believe is important is learning PHP. If i'm not mistaken I believe I read that we would be covering that later in the class.
I often read PHP being a required skill on indeed for certain programming positions and I look forward to being able to add that to my resume. Finally I think one of the most important things I'll get out of this class is confidence. By the end of this I hope to be very capable with HTML, JavaScript, and at least knwoledgeable with PHP.
